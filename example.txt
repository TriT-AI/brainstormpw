Current Situation: The Accounts Payable team currently manually extracts data from PDF invoices received via email and types the details into the SAP ERP system.
High manual data entry error rate (approx. 12%) requiring significant rework. Slow processing turnaround time averaging 4 business days per invoice, leading to vendor complaints.
Business Impact: The department incurs approximately $15,000 annually in late payment penalties and $40,000 in staff overtime costs due to process inefficiencies.

Goal: Implement an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) automation tool to reduce manual data entry for standard vendor invoices. KPI: Average Invoice Processing Time (Current: 30 minutes -> Target: 5 minutes) Target Date: 15/10/2026


Risk 1: The selected OCR software may have low accuracy rates with low-resolution scanned documents. Mitigation 1: Limit the initial scope to "digital-native" PDFs only and implement a "Human-in-the-Loop" review step for any document with a confidence score below 85%.

Risk 2: Integration with the legacy ERP system may be blocked by internal firewall rules. Mitigation 2: Engage the IT Security team during the design phase (Week 1) to define allow-lists and conduct a connectivity Proof of Concept before full implementation.
